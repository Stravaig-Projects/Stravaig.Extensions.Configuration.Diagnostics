Stravaig Projects: Configuration Diagnostics documentation!
===========================================================

`Stravaig.Extensions.Configuration.Diagnostics` is a set 
of extensions to assist diagnosing configuration setting 
issues by logging the current state which allows them to 
be examined. It also provides options for obfuscating 
secret values so that they are not exposed in application 
logs.
